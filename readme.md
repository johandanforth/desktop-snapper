# desktop-snapper

Desktop-snapper records your screen as you work. It is both a stand-alone program, but also an addin to 
Microsoft Outlook.

You control how often "snaps" of your desktop is taken, the quality of them, and where they
should be stored. Just remember to cleanout the image directory now and then.

Snapped images can be viewed and "played back".
